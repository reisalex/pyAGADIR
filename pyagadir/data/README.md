Lacroix, E., Viguera, A. R., & Serrano, L. (1998). Elucidating the folding problem of α-helices: local motifs, long-range electrostatics, ionic-strength dependence and prediction of NMR parameters. Journal of molecular biology, 284(1), 173-191. https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1998.2145

The paper uses the terminology of Richardson & Richardson (1988) where STC (S, strand; T, turn; and C, coil) indicates a non-helical conformation and He is a helical residue. Python indexing is used to describe these positions in the model.

## table_1_lacroix
Free energies in Kcal/mol for the intrinsic tendencies of the different amino acids to be at different positions of an a-helix.
The first column corresponds to the 20 amino acids in one letter. The N-terminus blocking acetyl or succynil groups are indicated by Ac and the C-terminus blocking amide group by Am.

Nc-1 	Normal N-cap values.
Nc-2 	N-cap values when there is a Pro at position N1.
Nc-3 	N-cap values when there is a Glu, Asp or Gln at position N3.
Nc-4 	N-cap values when there is a Pro at position N1 and Glu, Asp or Gln at position N3.
Cc-1 	Normal C-cap values.
Cc-2 	C-cap values when there is a Pro residue at position C’.
N1	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N1.
N2	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N2.
N3	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N3.
N4 	    Intrinsic helical propensities at position N4.
Ncen	Intrinsic helical propensities between N4 and C-cap. For charged residues these could change depending of the degree of ionisation.  
Neutral	Intrinsic helical propensities at positions higher than N4.


## table_2_lacroix
Energy contributions in Kcal/mol * 100, of the interactions between different amino acids at positions N' (rows) and N4 (columns) in a hydrophobic staple motif. 

The hydrophobic staple motif is only considered whenever the N-cap residue is Asn, Asp, Ser, Pro or Thr.  The above values are multiplied by 1 in the following cases: i) whenever the N-cap residue is Asn, Asp, Ser, or Thr and the N3 residue is Glu, Asp or Gln. ii) whenever the N-cap residue is Asp or Asn and the N3 residue is Ser or Thr.  In all other cases they are multiplied by 0.5.

## table_3_lacroix
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the interactions between the different amino acids at positions C3 (rows) and C’ (columns), in the Schellman motif. 

The Schellman motif is only considered whenever Gly is the C-cap residue.

## table_4a_lacroix
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the non-charged side chain-side chain interactions between the different amino acids at positions i,i+3. 

The interaction free energies correspond to those between non-charged residues, or in the case of two residues that can be charged to those cases in which at least one of the two is non-charged (the interaction is scaled according to the population of charged and neutral forms of the participating amino acids).  

## table_4b_lacroix
Energy contributions in cal/mol Kcal/mol * 100 of the non-charged side chain-side chain interactions between the different amino acids at positions i,i+4. 

The interaction free energies correspond to those between non-charged residues, or in the case of two residues that can be charged to those cases in which at least one of the two is non-charged (the interaction is scaled according to the population of charged and neutral forms of the participating amino acids).

## table_6_coil_lacroix
Average distance between charged groups (Å).

The distances shown in this table have been obtained from the analysis of the protein database, or from a modeled helix, as indicated in Methods and represent average values. In the different columns we show the distance between residues at position i and i+x.  The amino acid pairs are shown in one-letter code. The nomenclature for the helix position of the charged residues (columns N-cap etc...) is that of Richardson & Richardson (1988).

Rcoil 		Distance between i, i+x pairs of charged residues in the whole protein database.   
RcoilRest 		Average distance between i, i+x pairs of charged residues in the reference state 
		not included in Rcoil. 

## table_6_helix_lacroix
Average distance between charged groups (Å).

The distances shown in this table have been obtained from the analysis of the protein database, or from a modeled helix, as indicated in Methods and represent average values. In the different columns we show the distance between residues at position i and i+x.  The amino acid pairs are shown in one-letter code. The nomenclature for the helix position of the charged residues (columns N-cap etc...) is that of Richardson & Richardson (1988).

Helix		Distance between i 	i+x pairs of charged residues located inside an a-helix (excluding caps). 
Helixrest 		The same but for all possible charged pairs not included before. 
Ncap		Distance between the N-cap residue (i) and a helical residue located at position i+x.  
N’		Distance between the residue at position N’ (i) and a helical residue located at position i+x. 
Ccap		Distance between the C-cap residue (i) and a helical residue located at position i-x. 
C’		Distance between residue C’ (i) when residue C’ is not a Gly and a helical residue 
		located at position i-x. 
C’gcap		Distance between residue C’ (i) when residue C’ is a Gly and a helical residue 
		located at position i-x.  The presence of a Gly allows dihedral angles forbidden, 
		or not favourable, for other residues and therefore affects to the distance between 
		a charged group at position C’ and the helix charged residues.  
N-cap f 		Distance between the free N-terminal group when this group is located at the N-cap 
		position and a helical residue at position i+x.  
N’ f 		Distance between the free N-terminal group, when this group is located at position N’, 
		and a helical residue at position i+x. 
C-cap f 		Distance between the free C-terminal group, when this group is located at the C-cap 
		position, and a helical residue at position i-x.   
C’ f 		Distance between the free C-terminal group, when this group is located at position C’, 
		and a helical residue at position i-x.  

## table_7_Ncap_lacroix
Distances (Å) between charged amino acids and the half charge from the helix macrodipole.

The distances in Å shown in this table have been obtained from the analysis of the protein database as indicated in Methods.  The nomenclature for the helix position of the charged residues (columns N-cap etc...) is that of Richardson & Richardson (1988).

## table_7_Ccap_lacroix
Distances (Å) between charged amino acids and the half charge from the helix macrodipole.

The distances in Å shown in this table have been obtained from the analysis of the protein database as indicated in Methods.  The nomenclature for the helix position of the charged residues (columns N-cap etc...) is that of Richardson & Richardson (1988).

## pka_values
The pKa values for N- and C-termini as well as ionizable side chains when incorporated in a peptide. The values are from Nozaki and Tanford 1969 (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(67)11088-4). The value for Arginine (R) is from a different source.
